// List of sports
// ChangeSportsList - a method that will change the list of sports that should be.
// ChangeDuration - method that will change the duration of the games with properties from and to.
// ChangeNumberOfSportsGames, ChangeListOfCountries, and ChangeNumberOfPeople - each of these methods should change the datÐ° regardless of the number of games that might be included or excluded, also with countries that might contest and the number of people as well.

// Extra requirements
// Separate Individual and Team sports as classes that will inherit from Sport and remove the method Winner in the Sport class
// In TeamSports class you should keep a history of all matches that were played for that sport (EX. Sport is Handball and Macedonia won against Denmark with 60 - 50 (total numbers of goals from the two matches) also Macedonia won against Spain 40 - 38 and Spain won against Denmark with 39 - 38...The first place goes to Macedonia, then Spain, then Denmark (do not limit yourself to 3 teams (countries))). The format of all results should be the first country name (total result) - second country name (total result). Add method winner that will calculate and add medals.
// In IndividualSports class you should as well keep a history of all matches with the names of all countries and their result. The format of the match should be the name of the country (total result). Add method winner that will calculate and add medals (bare in mind the history of all matches should not be in order by countries result (let say the sport is swimming 50m butterfly M - and the results are England (5), Macedonia (1), USA (2), Serbia (4), Italy (3)...We can see that the result of the match are not in order so you need to pick the one that has the lowest rank, the second lowest rank, and the third lowest rank) and to that countries, you should add medals).
